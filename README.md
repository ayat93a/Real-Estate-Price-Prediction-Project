# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction-Project
This data science project walked through step by step process of how to build a **Real Estate Price Prediction Project**. I built a model using `sklearn` and `linear regression` using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com.\
 During model building  **I utlized almost all data science concepts** such as ```data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning and k fold cross validation.```

 # Technology and tools Utlized during this project :
1) Python
2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3) Matplotlib for data visualization
4) Sklearn for model building
5) Jupyter notebook and visual studio code and IDE
